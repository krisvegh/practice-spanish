# Practice Spanish

This app is just a hobby project of mine to practice Spanish words, expressions and verb conjugations. 

## Settings

### Words / Phrases mode
The app will randomly chose X (the nr of word limit) words from its dictionary that you need to guess. 

### Phrases
If you use a lifeline for a word, the app will try to find a phrase with the word you didn't know. 

### Verbs / Conjugations mode
The app will randomly chose X (the nr of word limit) verbs with a selected mood and selected tens(es) and you have to guess.

### Lifelines
Using a lifeline will not remove the current word/phrase from the dictionary, so you'll see it again sooner or later. Same applies for phrases. 

### Practice specific verb
Add a verb in spanish present infinitive format to the input, and the app will only add that verbs in different persons.
